<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received the B.S. degree, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Jilin University (JLU), Changchun, China, in 2017, and 2023 respectively. I have been a Visiting Student with the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD), at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) with Prof. Tony Q. S. Quek, in 2022. 

My research interest includes mobile crowdsensing, federated learning, and edge computing.
